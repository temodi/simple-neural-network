#Single layer feedforward neural network example
This is a simple implementation of neural network (perceptron) in NodeJS.  

##Overview

This is a simple layer feedforward neural network. It is implented under NodeJS. I made it because i wanted to learn more about perceptrons and neural networks.

##Usage

Run ``node index.js`` in terminal to train a random dataset.

##Credits

This example based on [The Nature of Code](http://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-10-neural-networks/)  by Daniel Shiffman
